<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I just started my first training as a web developer. My fathers was an "IT" for BMW South Africa. It was always fascinating
  to see him working. I've always wondered what all the "IT" typing meaned when my father worked. My father tried to
  explain but I didn't really understand.
</p>

<p>When my father got sick I've told him I want to learning something new. He told me to learn web developing. When he
  passed away. I've made a promise to myself to do the training. 
</p>

<p>I'm very proud of myself of what I have achieved so far. And I think my father would have been very proud of
  me.
